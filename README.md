### Overview
Create new chord progressions at the press of a button! This app allows the user to create new and inventive chord progressions. The user selects a 'key' and then a prefered 'mode' (major or minor), then clicks the "Write a song" button. Voila! A brand new chord progression using six of the diatonic triads found in the selected key. Users can then press and hold the chord card to hear the chord played. This allows songwriters to start hearing the potential chord progression without ever picking up their instrument.
